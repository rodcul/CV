## Rodney Cullen

I am a [global citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_citizenship) that can be found frequently pondering what are the biggest challenges we face as a society and how to go about solving them. I am borderline OCD around [effectiveness and efficiency](http://quotes.lifehack.org/quote/peter-drucker/efficiency-is-doing-things-right-effectiveness-is/). Through years of experience I have developed a keen understanding of tech, people and how to ship projects while enjoying the process!

I'm looking for a team of smart people with a clear vision that are focused on solving a problem that factors in the [triple bottom line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_bottom_line) that can support me in further developing my coding skills while leveraging my previous knowledge and experience around tech & Agile.


## Skills

#### Team Lead

I was responsible for building and managing a dev focused team with the goal of shipping an initial prototype to gauge Barcelona as a base for a new office.

After 4 months the following was delivered:

- A central office space equipped for comfort (& fun!)
- An initial team of 2 backend devs, 1 frontend dev & an Agile Coach
- Clearly defined technical stack & agile processes (TDD, Continuous Integration, Capistrano for deploys, JIRA with custom workflows, AWS...)
- A platform that could handle 10 Million pagesviews/day

The [Kodify](https://www.facebook.com/kodify/photos_stream) office subsequently took over the operations of a larger network of sites that now manages over 40 Million pageviews/day.


#### Product Manager

+4 years experience bridging the tech/business gap working with stakeholders and development teams to deliver high quality solutions on web & mobile web platforms.

- Solid understanding of our technical stack & processes and how that related to the development process

#### Agile Coach

After discovering Agile around 5 years ago, I've been fortunate enough to work alongside some of the most well regarded mentors and coaches in Spain.

- I successfully implemented Agile processes at the last 2 companies I worked at
- I have run workshops and speaking engagements on Agile
- I have collaborated at incubators and accelerators, mentoring teams with their processes, creating a custom "flavor" of Agile for teams that where working within a 3 month incubation program.

#### Growth Hacking & Online Marketing

Passionate about SEO, for many years I've been fascinated with Google and it's ability to provide targeted, highly qualified traffic. I am currently interested in using my new found coding skills to play around with machine learning as a way to optimize the SEO process.

- I have spoken at conferences  ([Congreso Seo Profesional](http://www.congresoseoprofesional.com/ponentes/rodney-cullen/) &  [Joomla Day!](https://flic.kr/p/99rgdv) among others) &  run [workshops](https://twitter.com/DemiumStartups/status/565558419189690370/photo/1)

- Participated in multiple hackathons ([1st place](http://allstartup.es/allstartup4-dia-3-apogeo-y-cierre/), [3rd place](http://blog.geekli.st/post/98065680547/the-winning-teams-of-the-geeklist-hack4good) - [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKo-Sh5F9QM))

I have been accepted into the upcoming edition of [Hive](http://hive.org/) conscious leadership program in San Francisco. (Hive is a global network of leaders and entrepreneurs who are working to create a better world.).

#### Makers Academy (April 2015 to July 2015)

For many years I have been the only person in the room that couldn't code, so I decided to join Makers Academy to deepen my understanding and passion for tech.

#### Bachelor of Industrial Design - Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (2000-2004)
